    <h1>Hour of Code 2023 - Press</h1>

    <p>
      The <strong>D³ Lab</strong> proudly hosted the <strong>Hour of Code</strong> on 
      <strong>Tuesday, December 5, 2023</strong>, through the K-State Computer Science Department. 
      The event was part of the global <em>Computer Science Education Week</em> and aimed to 
      introduce computer science to families and children through hands-on, playful learning. 
      It reflected the D³ Lab’s mission to make computer science accessible, engaging, and developmentally 
      appropriate for learners of all ages.
    </p>

    <p>
      The event welcomed over <strong>70 registrants</strong> including families with children from preschool to middle school. 
      The department’s classrooms were transformed into a lively discovery space filled with movement, 
      laughter, and color. Families explored activities together while K-State student volunteers guided 
      children through fun coding challenges and creative problem-solving exercises.
    </p>

 
    <p>
      Upon arrival, parents completed consent and photo forms, while children received bright stamp cards. 
      Each completed activity earned a stamp, encouraging exploration across multiple learning zones. 
      Once children collected four stamps, they returned to the Info table to receive personalized 
      certificates and small prizes celebrating their accomplishment. 
      The goal was to reward curiosity and perseverance while making learning fun and meaningful.
    </p>

   

    <p>
      The event featured <strong>four themed areas</strong>, each tailored to a specific age group and learning level.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Little Tech Explorers (Ages 0–6)</strong> — Introduced computing ideas through unplugged, playful activities. 
        Children hopped through <em>Code Hopper</em> mats to practice sequencing and logic, crafted their own algorithms in 
        <em>Code a Cat</em>, and listened to coding-themed storybooks that turned programming into storytelling.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Block Adventures I & II (Ages 8+)</strong> — Focused on creativity and digital design. 
        Using <em>HatchXR</em>, participants built an interactive <strong>VR Piano</strong>, 
        while others created a <strong>ChatGPT-powered chatbot</strong> modeled after Albert Einstein 
        using <em>creativeCode</em>, gaining insight into artificial intelligence and machine learning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Byte Innovators (Ages 6+)</strong> — Combined coding, logic, and hands-on play. 
        Children turned drawings into video games in <strong>Game Design</strong>, 
        learned how hardware and software interact in <strong>Networking with Makey Makey + Scratch</strong>, 
        and explored sorting and classification through the fun <strong>Data Science Detective</strong> game.
      </li>
    </ul>

   

    <p>
      Throughout the event, families moved between stations, experimenting with both unplugged and digital activities. 
      Volunteers celebrated each child’s success—clapping, encouraging, and helping debug when something didn’t work right. 
      Parents often joined in, helping their children problem-solve or create together. 
      The atmosphere was filled with joy and curiosity, turning what could have been “just coding” 
      into an afternoon of creativity and collaboration.
    </p>

    <p>
      For many volunteers, it was their first experience teaching young children. 
      The D³ Lab trained them beforehand on how to simplify computer science concepts, 
      communicate clearly, and make every interaction encouraging and inclusive. 
      Their enthusiasm and teamwork played a vital role in the event’s success. 
    </p>



    <p>
      By the end of the day, around <strong>32 families</strong> had actively participated in the activities, 
      making it one of the largest community outreach events for the department that semester. 
      Parents praised the inclusive design, noting how their children were excited to “code again” after the event. 
      The <strong>D³ Lab</strong>’s frameworks transformed abstract computing ideas into experiences children could 
      see, touch, and understand — proving that even at an early age, learners can think computationally when guided 
      through creativity and play.
    </p>

    <p>
      The success of the Hour of Code demonstrated the D³ Lab’s leadership in bridging research, teaching, 
      and community engagement. It showcased how thoughtful educational design can empower families, 
      strengthen community connections, and inspire the next generation of thinkers, creators, and problem solvers.
    </p>
