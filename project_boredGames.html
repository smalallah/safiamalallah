        <h1>Board & Card Games</h1>
        <p>
         Board and card games are structured play activities that use physical pieces, cards, or dice to guide players toward specific goals. 
We create unplugged board and card games that help learners explore computer science, AI, and data science concepts through movement and hands-on play. 
Some games are designed for tables, while others are large floor games where children can move, jump, and interact with CS concepts no screens required.

          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-layer-group"></i> 1. CT Concept Cards</h3>
          <p>
            A collectible <strong>card game</strong> where each card represents a key <em>computational thinking concept</em>—
            such as sequencing, decomposition, abstraction, or debugging.  
            Players draw, trade, and combine cards to complete real-world “challenge missions.”

          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-chart-line"></i> 2. Data Science Board Game</h3>
          <p>
            A dice-and-cards <strong>data adventure game</strong> that teaches how data is collected, cleaned, and visualized.  
            Players roll, analyze, and compete to make discoveries—learning data literacy while having fun.

          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-hand"></i> 3. Simon Says: AI Edition</h3>
          <p>
            A <strong>card-based version</strong> of “Simon Says” that introduces children to
            <em>machine learning patterns</em>—follow the rules that AI “learns,” spot the biases, and adapt as the “model” evolves.  
            Great for group movement and reflection.

          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-person-running"></i> 4. The Hopping Board Game</h3>
          <p>
            A large-floor or outdoor <strong>movement game</strong> where children jump between AI concept tiles—like “Data,”
            “Pattern,” “Decision,” and “Feedback Loop.”  
            Each hop unlocks a question or mini-challenge about how AI learns.
